# Simple Plutus

This is an idealized Haskell implementation of
[IOHK](https://iohk.io)'s
[Plutus](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus)
smart contract language for the
[Cardano blockchain](https://cardano.org/)

It ignores cryptography, consensus, serialization and networking
and concentrates on the fundamental ideas of how Plutus works.

This idealized version of Plutus is close enough to the "real thing"
to convey a realistic taste of what writing Plutus contracts feels like.
